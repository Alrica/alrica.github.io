     <h1> About HTJD  </h1>
<br>
<p> HTJD is an organization formed by Alrica Antoine for  juvenile
delinquents or eligible delinquents to help change their behaviors
so that they can be accepted into society. This organization is broken into
two parts the first part of the programm is where we bring in
different psychologists to talk to the teenagers as most times they are not
having this emotional support at home. the second part is where we have activites
planned out to help the kids develop positive self confidence and self-esteem.
There are also days where the teenagers are given supplies to do something
that they are good at like cooking, baking, woodworking, crafting, painting or
even gardening skills and then go out to sell their work to community members.</p>

     <h2> About Me </h2>
<br>
<p>My name is Alrica Antoine and I am from the beautiful country of Saint Lucia.
I am fifteen years of age and currently attend the Vieux Fort Comprehensive
Secondary School. My passions are reading, taking care of children and helping others
out. I chose to create the organization because as I said one of my passions are
helping others and I believe that every teenager deserves a chance to change their
delinquent behaviors especially if it is not their fault that they behave this way.
Another resason is that I as an individual think that my community could become
a safer place for teens to feel confident in themselves and have good self-esteem.
