    <h1> What is HTJD? </h1>
     <p> Helping The Juvenile Delinquents is an organization where a group of
young individaul come together to help the juvenile delinquents. Most Teenagers
bcome delinquents because they do not have a family that they can depend
on for love, affection and attention. Our organization gives them a family
that they can talk to. There are different activites that we put in place to help
them regain their self confidence and self-esteem. Here's some information
about juvenile delinquence </p>

        <h3> Causes Of Juvenile Delinquence </h3>
    <br>

      <h4> Broken Family </h4>
      <br>
<p> A teen adopts moral and ethnical values from hos or her parents and other family
members. It goes without saying that family plays a vital role in shaping a teen's
behavior and growing his or her personality. However, teens become violent or show
signs of juvenile delinquency only when they're facing disturbance at home.
Broken or disturbed families with bad relations can cause teens to go astray
and become violent. SIngle parents are often busy working, therefore they're not
able to spend quality time with their children.This causes teens to seek
attention from others, especially their peers.</p>
<br>
    <h5> Lack of communication </h5>
<p> Often lack of discourse in the family can lead children to find solace other than
homes. When they are not having any communication with their parents or family members
at home, they may lose unity, trust, and understanding, which can eventually
lower their self-esteem or self confidence, once they feel they're losing
their individuality, they tend to do things they shouldn't do to boost
their self confidence. They blindly follow their peers and adopt their
unhealty lifestyles. They shoplift and consume drugs to look cool in the
eyes of their peers. </p>
<br>
    <h6> Lack Of Finances </h6>
<p> Young or adult, may lead to a wrong path to improve their finacial conditions.
Teens become juvenile delinquents due to lack of finances. When they
experience poor economic conditions, thye start engadging in the wrong activites.
They may start selling drugs or steal things to improve their economic
conditions. </p>
<br>
     <h6> Lack Of Social And Moral Training </h6>
<p> Teens who have not been given any social or moral training often lead
  to juvenile delinquency. It is the parent's duty to teach moral and ethnicl
  values to their children. They should teach them the difference between
  right and wrong behavior. Lack of social and moral values can lead
  children to poor interacton with others and make them less confident.
  They may become selfish and arrogant. They would not know how to respect
  the laws of state. Parents often neglect their children and play more focus on
  working hard to earn money for them. However, while doing so, they forget
  the importance of spending quality time with their children. In their
  absence, children tend to spend time with someone who pays attention to
  them. They may also fall into wrong hands or get involved in a bad company
  while seeking attention from someone other than their parents. </p>
<br>
<p> Usually when a teen commits a small offense, people especially parents,
  just show momentary disapproval and then forget about it. They just think
  of it as a one-time mistake made by a child who doesn't know what he or she is
  doing and that he must have learned his or her lesson and will not attempt
  the same thing again, however, quite often thsi doesn't turn out to be the case.
  Failing to show due concern over a teen's delinquent behavior and taking
  neccessary measures to discourage it can have a serious consequence
  not just for the teen, but also their parents.
